                        <p>
                            <strong>DOK2</strong> (pronounced "Dokki"), born Lee Joon-kyung on March 28, 1990, is a South 
                            Korean rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He is widely recognized as a pioneer in the Korean 
                            hip-hop scene and has played a significant role in popularizing the genre both in Korea and 
                            internationally. Known for his distinctive rap style, charismatic presence, and prolific production

                            young age. Influenced by hip-hop from an early age, he started writing and producing his own music 
                            as a teenager. At 13, Dok2 was already making beats and quickly caught the attention of 
                            established Korean hip-hop artists. <br><br>

                            He first gained recognition as part of the hip-hop duo All Black with rapper Microdot in 2006,
